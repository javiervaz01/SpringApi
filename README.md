# SpringApi
Spring API created by Francisco Javier VÃ¡zquez Monge for the weekly assessment.

I have developed the API with Spring boot, so, in order to run the application, it is just neccessary to press the 'run' command that appears in Visual Studio Code above the main application's name:
[[Picture of what is the button to run the project]](https://ibb.co/61RBtMx)

It would also be possible just to run the application in Eclipse, by right clicking in the main Application's file and pressing run as: java application.


The API has been tested using TDD and has several functionalities:
-Get all possible contacts
-Get all possible future actions
-Get all possible opportunities
-Get all possible clients
-Get each of the types described before by their personal Id
-Change a contact to future action and viceversa
-Tests including all functionalities described before
